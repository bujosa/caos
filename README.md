# Caos - Employee Management System

Caos is a smart contract designed to manage employee information, track hours worked, calculate payroll, and process payments securely and efficiently. It allows employees to input their personal and professional information and provides an interface for them to log their hours worked. The contract uses this information to calculate employee pay and can process payments using cryptocurrency or traditional currency.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The code consists of four main functions:

Employee Registration
The registerEmployee function allows employees to register their personal and professional information, including their name, date of hire, salary, and position in the company. This information is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or accessed by unauthorized parties.

## Hour Tracking

The logHours function allows employees to log their hours worked using an interface accessible through the web or mobile. This information is automatically recorded and used to calculate employee pay.

## Payroll Calculation

The calculatePayroll function uses the information stored in the contract to calculate each employee's pay based on their hourly rate and the number of hours worked. The result is stored in the contract, ready for payment processing.

## Payment Processing

The processPayment function enables the contract to process payments to employees using cryptocurrency or traditional currency. This function accesses the stored payroll information and initiates a payment transaction to the employee's specified account.

## Transaction Logging

The logTransaction function records all payment transactions made by the contract, providing a clear and accurate record of all financial activity.

### Conclusion

Caos provides an efficient and secure solution for managing employee information, tracking hours worked, calculating payroll, and processing payments. Its smart contract design ensures the privacy and security of employee data while providing a reliable and accurate payroll system.
